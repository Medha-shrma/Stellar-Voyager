# Stellar-Voyager
Stellar Voyager is a skill-based 2D space game where players pilot a lone starship through deadly gravitational fields. Master momentum-driven physics with precise thruster control, collect scarce Energy Orbs, and unleash anti-gravity boosts. Each level is a high-stakes puzzle of strategy, reflex, and survival.
