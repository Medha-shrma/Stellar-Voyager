# Stellar-Voyager
Stellar Voyager is a challenging, skill-based 2D game where players pilot a lone starship through treacherous gravitational fields. The core gameplay revolves around mastering momentum-based physics with precise thruster controls to navigate planets, asteroids, and black holes. Players must collect scarce Energy Orbs to power a unique anti-gravity boost, transforming each level into a high-stakes puzzle that demands skill, reflexes, and strategic thinking.

# Story and Narrative Synopsis
The year is 2242. Humanity’s outer colonies have fallen silent as a mysterious gravitational anomaly spreads across the galaxy, devouring entire star systems. Normal ships cannot withstand its crushing forces. The only hope lies in the XV-Stellar Voyager, an experimental prototype equipped with a revolutionary anti-gravity drive.

You are its pilot—a former daredevil from the now-lost colonies—tasked with venturing into the heart of the anomaly. Your mission: gather Energy Orbs, the dying remnants of collapsed stars, and use them to fuel your ship’s boost. Only by reaching the Exit Portal at the anomaly’s center and unleashing a stabilizing pulse can you save what remains of humanity.

# How the Story Enhances Gameplay
Energy Orbs: More than collectibles, they are the lifeblood of survival, powering both your ship and humanity’s last hope.
Anti-Gravity Boost: A mission-critical technology, limited in use, designed for tactical escapes and daring maneuvers.
Exit Portal: Not just a finish line, but the gateway to stabilizing the anomaly and securing the galaxy’s future.

# Core Physics Engine
gravity: Simplified universal gravitation (a = (G * Mass) / distance²) pulls the ship toward celestial bodies.
Drag: Constant damping ensures control over velocity, preventing runaway acceleration.
Boost Mechanic: Temporarily inverts gravity with a -2 multiplier, repelling from celestial bodies to enable daring escapes.
