A 2D Sci-Fi Physics Arcade / Puzzler

**Stellar Voyager** is a challenging, skill-based 2D game where players pilot a lone starship through treacherous gravitational fields. The gameplay revolves around mastering **momentum-based physics** with precise thruster controls to navigate planets and black holes. Players must collect scarce **Energy Orbs** to power a unique **anti-gravity boost**, turning each level into a high-stakes puzzle that tests skill and strategic thinking.

## Story and Narrative Synopsis 

In the year **2242**, the outer colonies have fallen silent. A mysterious and expanding gravitational anomaly is tearing through star systems, threatening all of humanity. Normal ships are helpless, but a single pilot, a former daredevil from the now-devoured colonies is tasked with flying the **XV-Stellar Voyager**, an experimental prototype with a unique anti-gravity drive.

Your mission is a desperate flight into the heart of the chaos to collect scattered **Energy Orbs** - the last remnants of dying stars. You must use the ship's boost to defy the crushing gravity of planets and black holes, navigating to the stable **Exit Portal** at the anomaly's center to unleash a pulse that can save what's left of the galaxy.

## How the Story Enhances Gameplay 

The narrative is designed to give every gameplay mechanic a clear purpose:

* The **Energy Orbs** are framed as a scarce, vital resource needed to keep your mission alive. It is a desperate act of survival, not just powering up.
* The **anti-gravity boost** is the ship's mission-critical technology. Its limited use is tactical and significant.
* The **Exit Portal** isn't just a finish line, it is the key to stabilizing the anomaly and saving the colonies.

## Controls and User Interface 

The controls and UI are designed to be intuitive and clean, ensuring an accessible and immersive experience.

### Control Scheme

| Action | Controls (Desktop) | Controls (Touch) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ship Movement** | Arrow Keys or WASD Keys | An on-screen D-pad |
| **Anti-Gravity Boost** | Spacebar | A central button |
| **Menu Navigation** | Mouse Click | Tap |

### User Interface

The UI features a sleek, **retro-futuristic neon theme**, using the **Orbitron font** against a deep-space background to create a cohesive sci-fi atmosphere.

* The interface is minimalistic to keep focus on the action.
* It cleanly displays the **Level Name**, **remaining Orb count**, and a **real-time velocity display**.
* Sound is muted by default and can be enabled with a single click in the top-right corner.

## Technical Details 

### Development Technologies

* **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* **Game Engine:** **Vanilla JavaScript**, leveraging the browser's built-in **Canvas API** (`CanvasRenderingContext2D`) for all rendering and physics calculations.
* **Audio:** Standard HTML5 Audio API is used for sound effects and music playback
* **UI Styling:** Tailwind CSS

### Performance and Stability

* Optimized rendering directly via the Canvas API.
* Compressed image assets for fast load times.
* Tested for cross-browser and mobile compatibility.

### Core Physics Engine 

The game is powered by a **custom engine** that simulates momentum-based space flight.

* **Gravity:** A simplified universal gravitation formula ($\text{acceleration} = (G \times \text{Mass}) / \text{distance}^2$) pulls the ship toward celestial bodies.
* **Drag:** A **constant damping factor** is applied to the ship's velocity to prevent uncontrolled acceleration and make navigation more manageable.
* **Boost Mechanic:** Activating the boost temporarily **inverts the gravity formula with a -2 modifier**, turning the pull of planets into a powerful repulsive force for strategic escapes.
